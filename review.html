<h2>Sun Microsystems</h2>
<img src="sun.jpg" alt="Sun Microsystems" style="width:304px;height:228px"><br>
</br>
<pre>Sun Microsystems was the company behind the development of the well-known Java programming language, 
as well as other products and services. As of the summer of 2010, Oracle has <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/018363">acquired</a> Sun Microsystem, Inc.<sup>1</sup 
Before this major change, Sun Microsystems was a company that enabled several key computing technologies to 
evolve significantly; most of these technologies were used to build Sun’s infrastructure.</pre>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<pre>Since the late 1980s Sun Microsystems have used its own design of an <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/R/RISC.html">RISC</a> processor architecture, when they created 
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC">SPARC<a/>. Since 2007 Sun used the updated form of their design in the <a href="https://www.fujitsu.com/global/Images/T5440-wp-e-200907.pdf">UltraSPARC T2 Plus</a>, which has an 8-core chipset, 
64 bit computing rate, 2 memory controllers,up to 16 or 32 FB-DIMMs.<sup>2</sup>  What benefits that came with the RISC processor architecture was that RISC 
was able to scale up in performance quite quickly and cheaply. Sun also paired up their processors with the <a href="http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/80386/">Intel 80386</a>-based machine, 
this was designed to be a hybrid system, running Sun OS but at the same time supporting DOS applications.<sup>3</sup> 
<h3>Open Source</h3>
<pre>One fully open source implementation of the SPARC architecture was
<a href="http://www.ijirt.org/paperpublished/IJIRT100220_PAPER.pdf">LEON</a>, which is a 32-bit, SPARC Version 8 implementation, designed especially for space use. 
The Source code is written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHSIC_Hardware_Description_Language">VHDL</a>, and licensed under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GPL</a>.<sup>4</sup>
</pre>
<h2>Software</h2>
<pre>Sun’s UNIX operating system, <a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_%28operating_system%29">Solaris</a>, was “developed as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">proprietary software</a>”, but Sun released 
“most of the software’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codebase">codebase</a> under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Development_and_Distribution_License">CDDL</a> license.”<sup>5</sup>
On Sun’s SPARC system, Solaris was known for its scalability and had a “reputation for being well-suited to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing">symmetric multiprocessing</a>, supporting a large number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>s.”<sup>6</sup>
In order to allow programs to function regardless of the device they were used on, Sun developed and ran Java, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oriented programming</a> language; one of the world’s most 
popular programming languages. </pre>
<h3>Open Source/ Special Software</h3>
<pre>Openoffice: Open sources office suit which was written in C++ and Java and was for the Linux, OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Solaris OS. 
Openoffice was created on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IA-32">IA-32</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">x86-64</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC">PowerPC</a>, and SPARC platforms. The size of the suit is 143.4 MB.
</pre>
<h2>Servers</h2>
<h3>Web Servers</h3>
<pre>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Fire_X4500">Sun Fire X4500</a> coincided with the UltraSPARC iii processors. The Sun Fire X4500 server maintains two dual-core <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD">AMD</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opteron">Opteron</a> processors and up to 64 GB RAM. 
With 48 500/1000/2000 GB <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SATA">SATA</a> drives, it provides 24/48 TB of storage in 4 rack units.<sup>7</sup></pre>
<h3> Database Servers</h3>
<pre>For their database purposes Sun “acquired <a href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL_AB">MySQL AB</a>, the developer of the MySQL database in 2008 for 1 billion US dollars.”<sup>8</sup> </pre>
<h2>Deployment Strategies & Security</h2>
<pre>Although at this point Sun has been acquired by Oracle, their security strategies have been adopted by Oracle. The most current implementation of security strategy was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Application_Server">Oracle Application Server</a> 
on <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/id-mgmt/overview/index.html">Oracle Identity Management</a>. 
“Installing and deploying Oracle Application Server components involves creating identities for the applications being deployed and granting them run-time privileges to necessary resources, such as Oracle Application Server infrastructure schema, 
and access to other application components. Without proper delegation, deployment of any application would require the directory administrator to be involved. On the other hand, with excessive privilege delegation, 
an administrator with privileges to deploy one application will also have unwarranted privileges over other applications. 
With proper delegation, specific administrators can be de granted privileges to specific applications.”<sup>9</sup> </pre>
