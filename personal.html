<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<h3>Family</h3>
<p id="family">My twin and I were born July 26, 1992. I have 3 older sisters and an older brother; I also have a handful of nieces and nephews. After doing some research,
I found out my father is of Ghanaian descent and my mother is of Nigerian descent from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people">Yoruba tribe</a>. I was born and raised in Ann Arbor, MI; but I am not a <a href="http://www.ahajokes.com/michigan_jokes.html">Wolverines</a> fan LOL!
A lot of people ask me if my sister and I are identical but no we aren't. I have found out that we are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin#Fraternal_.28sororal.3B_dizygotic.29_twins" target="_blank">sororal</a> (two girls), fraternal twins. Interesting!!</p>
<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p id="hobby"> I love listening to music, pretty much anything that has a great beat. Although I don't listen to country music, I like the music videos lol. I am that one person
that enjoys doing random searches on Wikipedia and comparing it to other research. I enjoy action, comedy and sometimes drama movies. Although I am in college and do not have a lot
time to read leisurely, I still love to read fiction novels. It also may come to some surprise, but I love playing video games. Ever since I was young my nephews and I would play the classic
<a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.">Super Mario Bros</a>. and other Super Nintendo games.</p>
